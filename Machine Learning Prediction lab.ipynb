Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a3502279-c87c-4494-9799-0974bc980e3b"},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/landing_1.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4fa3a01f-845d-41ea-b270-b4bf5bf288d5"},"source":["Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a1a65dc9-efa1-4712-ad5e-c2f09aea28ea"},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/crash.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1b6bbc71-b199-4ead-b561-74e36a31466e"},"source":["Most unsuccessful landings are planed.
